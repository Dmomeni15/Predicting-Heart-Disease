# Predicting-Heart-Disease
Heart Disease is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, impacting millions of Americans each year and exerting a significant financial burden on the economy. The purpose of this project is to use data analysis techniques to identify groups with the highest risk of heart disease and use the shared characteristics of these groups to predict whether someone is at risk of heart disease. We will first use contingency tables, conditional entropy, and odds ratios to identify at-risk groups and key predictor variables; more detail regarding at-risk groups will come from crossing multiple variables, and seeing which variables recur in the most-significantly-different groupings. Then, we will create a set of decision rules to determine whether a new respondent is at risk of heart disease. We will then compare this classifierâ€™s performance with that of a gradient boosted decision tree algorithm. We will also be using a general linear model to determine which predictor variables play the most importance when it comes to heart problems within patients. Tests will be conducted with a focus on AIC, logarithmic odds, summary statistics, and plots to aid in our determination of a best general linear model.
